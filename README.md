# FHSU Social Icons Generator
> Generate icons for FHSU webpages

This website generates the code necessary to create social media [icons](https://github.com/fhsu-um/patterns/tree/main/social-icons) for use on the [FHSU](https://www.fhsu.edu/) website, making the repetitive task of replacing old icons a little bit easier.

**NOTE:** Form inputs are not validated, so make sure your URLs are correct before generating.
